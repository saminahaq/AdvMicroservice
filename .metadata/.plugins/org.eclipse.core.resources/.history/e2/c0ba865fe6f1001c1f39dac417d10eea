Spring JPA [Ready Application]


JPA spring is object based programming and database has the tables not objects 
so we need to map particular class to particular tables.

and database worked for the tables form 
so , java created the standard specification e.g JPS specification 
so this specification used when creating the implementation 


so java provide the specification and we need to create the implementation
JPS specification through the ORM provider
