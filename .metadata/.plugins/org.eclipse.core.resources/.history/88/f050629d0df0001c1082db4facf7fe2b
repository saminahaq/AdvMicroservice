Add these following dependencies into the POM.xml

1: <artifactId>aspectjrt</artifactId>
2: <artifactId>aspectjweaver</artifactId>

keeping all the bean under the spring radar put the annotation "@Componenet"

For the Aspect creation, put the annotation @Aspect make the bean aspect 
e.g Logging, authentication anad authorization and data sanitization

Enable "@EnableAspectJAutoProxy" into the BeanConfig java file

	dot between the (..), shows the input parameter

@Before("execution(* *.*.CheckOut(..))") //any file has checkout method [* for any package second * for any class]
