Spring JPA [Ready Application]


JPA spring is object based programming and database has the tables not objects 
so we need to map particular class to particular tables.

Traditional Approach:
so through tables we are getting all record and converted into the  objects, but
now we don't need to do this conversion manually 
and we have different framework that do this functionality called is ORM 


ORM [Object relationship mapping]

and database worked for the tables form 
so , java created the standard specification e.g JPS specification 
so this specification used when creating the implemen  tation 


so java provide the specification and we need to create the implementation
JPS specification through the ORM provider
