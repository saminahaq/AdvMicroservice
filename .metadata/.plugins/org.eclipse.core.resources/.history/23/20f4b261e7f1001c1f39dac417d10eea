Spring JPA [Ready Application]


JPA spring is object based programming and database has the tables not objects 
so we need to map particular class to particular tables.

Traditional Approach:
so through tables we are getting all record and converted into the  objects, but
now we don't need to do this conversion manually 
and we have different framework that do this functionality called is ORM 


ORM [Object relationship mapping ]
so tables represent the object in ORM, so hibernate and iBAt defined these functionality 


Hiberante:

hibernate has it's own implementation of ORM , 
hiberante different functionality and session and object are behaving and interaction as compare to the iBAT.
so conversion between hiberanate and iBAT is very difficult so java provide the JPS specification 


JPS API specification: [JPS "Java persistance API Specificaion"]
 
java created the standard specification e.g JPS specification 
so this specification used when creating the implementation 
so java provide the specification and we need to create the implementation
JPS specification through the ORM provider 

so through the JPSAPI we can convert the iBAT and Hibernate easily, so need to implement the specification
